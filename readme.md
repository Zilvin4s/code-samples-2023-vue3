This is a code samples of vue3 + typescript in a project I've worked in 2023.

All these features were created by me from scratch, but somebody else might included their bug fix or a quick change.

The project folder structure was different, just copied related files into feature-related folders.

This is not fixed or adapted in any way to make it look better code wise, just copied files over to make them public.
